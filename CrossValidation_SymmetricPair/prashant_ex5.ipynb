    "In both tasks, use the K-nearest neighbors classifier with K=1 and Euclidean distance for learning and the concordance index for evaluation. You are encouraged to re-use your own code from the previous exercises. Use the data files `pairs.data`, `features.data`, and `labels.data` that are available in Moodle. The descriptions of these files are provided in the exercise overview, which is also available in Moodle.\n",
